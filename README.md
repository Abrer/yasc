Mostly trying to figure out how to GitHub.
Otherwise... a small Python2 project to get back into the swing of things.


##Yet Another Subnet Calculator


#####Last updated:   08 / 21 / 2014



  Last working on:

    Fixed CIDR masks lower than /8 returning a mask of 0.0.0.0

  TODO:

    - Fix Avail Subnets:
        191.168.5.4 /14 returns 0.25 because the class is wrong.

    - Add wildcard masks
    - Colorize output for better visibility -- hopefully with ANSI escape codes for $BASH.
            Maybe it works with Windows too?
