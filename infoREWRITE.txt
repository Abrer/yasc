""" Last working on:

            Fucking GITHUB intergration....
            Moved calc functions to their own file.
            Those functions are now imported.

    TODO:
        - Fix input of masks at /8 or lower:
            /8 shows 255.0.0
            Lower shows 0.0.0.0
        - Finish the GetClass() function! It's easy, dunno why I haven't bothered yet.
        - Fix line 92 -- use a for loop to add . for readability... mehbe.
        - Add subnets per host and etc...
        - Colorize output for better visibility -- hopefully with ANSI escape codes for $BASH.
